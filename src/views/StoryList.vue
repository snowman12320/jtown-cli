              Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, a
              15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the
              All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and
              a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring
              twice, and ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and
              postseason scoring. He was posthumously voted into the Naismith
